### Description

This is a project I created while generating QR codes for passes for the freshers party of IIIT Vadodara.
This takes input from csv files already stored on my machine.
This generates QR codes in .svg format, and then bunch mails it to all recepients. 
One has to provide his own csv files as an input to code
